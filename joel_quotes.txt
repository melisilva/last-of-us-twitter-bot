Tommy, I-...Tommy. Tommy, listen to me. He's the contractor, okay? I can't lose this job. I understand... Let's talk about this in the morning, okay? We'll talk about it in the morning. Alright, goodnight.
Scoot.
What are you still doing up? It's late.
It's way past your bedtime.
Honey, please not right now. I do not have the energy for this.
What's this?
Honey, this is...
It's nice, but I-...I think it's stuck. It's not...
Where did you get the money for this?
Oh, good. You can start helping out with the mortgage then.
Goodnight, baby girl.
Sarah. Are you okay?
Has anyone come in here?
Don't go near the doors. Just...just stand back there...
It's the Coopers. Somethin' ain't right with 'em. I think they're sick.
Jesus. Jimmy!
Honey, c'mere, c'mere.
Jimmy.
Jimmy, just stay back. Jimmy, I am warning you.
Don't!
Go. Go.
Sarah.
Listen to me, there is something bad going on. We have got to get out of here. Do you understand me?
Tommy. C'mon.
I got some notion. C'mon, baby. Get on in there.
It ain't mine. Let's just get outta here.
Can we just please go?
Later.
No cellphone. No radio. Yeah, we're doin' great.
They say where to go?
That means we need to get the hell out. Take 71.
Tommy.
Jesus Christ, how did this happen?
That's Louis' farm.
I'm sure he did.
No. No, of course not.
That's right, he did.
What the hell do you think you're doin'? Keep drivin'.
So do we.
Keep drivin', Tommy.
You ain't seen what I seen. Someone else'll come along.
Well...we could just backtrack and--
Turn us around. Tommy. Tommy!
What the fuck just happened? Did you see that?
Goddamn. Turn here. Turn here.
Get us outta here.
We can't stop here, Tommy.
Then back up then!
There. There! There!
What? Get back, baby. Get back. Look. I'm okay...
I'm here, baby. I'm here. Come on, gimme your hand.
What is it?
How bad?
Oh my god.
Now hold on tight.
Don't look, Sarah.
Just keep looking at me, baby.
We're gonna get outta this. I promise.
Jesus.
Goddammit. We're almost there. We're almost there, baby.
Keep going! Find a way outta here!
What?
I will meet you there.
He's gonna be fine. We're almost there.
It's okay, baby. We're safe. We're safe. Hey! We need help.
Please. It's my daughter. I think her leg's broken.
Okay...we're not sick.
We're gonna get you to safety and go back for him. Okay?
Listen, buddy, we've just been through hell. Okay, we just need--
Oh, shit.
Please, don't.
Sarah! Okay. Move your hands, baby.
I know, baby. I know...
Listen to me, I know this hurts, baby. You're gonna be okay, baby. Stay with me. Alright, I'm gonna pick you up. I know, baby. I know it hurts. Come on, baby, please. I know, baby. I know.
Sarah... Baby... Don't do this to me, baby. Don't do this to me, baby girl. Come on... No, no... Oh no, no, no... Please. Oh, God. Please, please, don't do this. Please, God...
I'm coming.
No, I don't...want one.
Where were you, Tess?
We. We had a drop to make.
So, I'll take one guess. The whole deal went south, and the client made off with our pills. Is that about right?
You want to explain this?
Gimme that.
Are these assholes still with us?
Did you find out who they were?
Our Robert?
That son of a bitch, he's smart.
Like hell you do.
Well, I'm ready now. Yeah?
Only got a few hours left until curfew.
That just means more people are sneakin' out.
Nothin'.
There you go.
Got the day off. Visiting a friend.
Thanks.
Outside the wall?
Cute.
I don't like it. We better find him before the Fireflies do.
Not a lot of ammo.
Yes, ma'am.
Go on.
Be careful.
That a trick question?
Ain't been out here in awhile.
Well I'm the romantic type.
It's gotta be around here somewhere. Got it.
Ladies first.
It's all relative.
For his sake...he better.
Speaking of merchandise, when's the next shipment due?
Yeah, well he always shows up with somethin'. Should keep us busy for
Where the hell are all these comin' from? Place was clear last time.
There's our culprit.
We should be able to fit through here. Oh, shit.
Yeah. Damn ceiling's falling apart. Be careful. This way. Easy...
Jesus. Watch it. Watch it.
Shh, shh, shh.
Let's hope so.
Why don't you ask Bill to get you some of them air fresheners?
I got it.
I'll get it.
It's a bit heavy.
Alright.
Bossy today.
Let's make sure there aren't any soldiers around.
You know he's expecting us.
Who's that?
Here we go.
Yeah.
You too. How the hell did he get all these guys?
Alright, c'mon...
Alright.
Shit, I see them.
They'd just slow us down.
Let's go wrap this up.
Robert!
C'mon, c'mon.
Well, now what?
How?
There you go: queen Firefly.
How do we know you got 'em? Way I hear it, the military been wiping you guys out.
So why now?
Looks like they did.
Ain't a big fan of these odds.
What the hell are we smuggling?
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Come on now, get up.
You're recruitin' kind of young, aren't ya?
Hey -- we're smuggling her?
Whoa, whoa. I don't think that's the best idea.
Was that before or after he left your little militia group?
Jesus Christ.
Don't take long. And you -- stay close. Let's go.
The Fireflies. Same thing's gonna happen to us if we don't get off the street.
Down here.
C'mon, keep up.
Up there, that'll get us to the north tunnel.
Just gimme a minute.
Yep.
Sometimes.
No. That's a first. So what's the deal with you and Marlene, anyways?
Your friend, huh? You're friends with the leader of the Fireflies. What're you, like twelve?
So where are your parents?
Hm. So instead of just staying in school, you decide to run off and join the Fireflies, is that it?
You wanna know the best thing about my job? I don't gotta know why. Be honest with you, I could give two shits about what you're up to.
Good.
This is it.
Killing time.
I am sure you will figure that out.
Yeah, me too.
What on earth do the Fireflies want with you?
Yeah.
Don't you think it's a bit strange that they're askin' us to do their smuggling?
Yeah, let's just hope there's someone alive to pay us.
Who's waitin' for us at the drop-off?
Now hold up. There's a patrol up ahead. Alright, we're good. Come on up. C'mon, kid. Watch your step.
This rain ain't gonna do us any good.
Up this way.
Jesus Christ. Marlene set us up? Why the hell are we smuggling an infected girl?
No? So was this lying?
I don't care how you got infected.
I ain't buying it.
Tess, run. RUN!
Shit, they're going to be out in numbers.
Goddammit! They're everywhere.
I see 'em, I see 'em.
Just stay back.
Stay down. Don't let them see you.
You see anything?
So far, so good.
Shh, shh, shh. I hear 'em up ahead.
We can get through here. Down through here.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
They ain't spotted us yet, let's go around.
There's too many, Tess?
Alright.
Shit.
We ain't stickin' around to find out.
That was too damn close, Tess. You better be worth it, kid. Tess, you got any idea which way?
Hang on. Let's see where this leads.
Well, at least we're out of the rain.
I think we can squeeze through here.
Shit, shit. I got more soldiers.
I don't think they see us.
Stay in the shadows.
Alright.
Sure thing, boss. Tess, up through here, through this pipe. I think we can make it through here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. Jesus.
Come on.
Alright, they're gone.
Yeah, we've heard that before, huh, Tess?
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, I'm sure she did.
Me neither. Tess, what the hell are we doing here?
I can't believe--
Do I need to remind you what is out there?
We hope.
Tess, do you hear that?
Shit.
Well, there's the capitol building.
Over here.
You find anything over there?
Keep looking.
You just stay close to her for now.
Hey, Tess.
Yeah...
Looks like these guys died waiting for backup.
Goddammit. Clicker.
Whole building feels like it's about to fall apart.
Gimme a hand with this.
Thanks...
It's nothin'.
C'mon. Let's get the hell outta here.
Just see if there's a way through.
Alright, kid, you're up.
Gimme a second.
Here you go, ladies.
Oh boy...
I'll go check it out. Stay with the girl.
Alright. Come on down.
Pssh. Let's just get outta here.
Alright. Tess, go.
Mm-hmm.
Let's get to it. We can get through here. Watch your back.
You want to take it easy?
And you always brushed me off.
I'll believe it when I see it. Through here.
These guys aren't doin' too well in or out of the city. Let's hope
They're from the quarantine zone.
Over there, see it?
This way. We're almost out. C'mon.
Alright. C'mon.
Get up here.
Everyone okay?
It's called luck, and it is gonna run out. Which way we goin', Tess?
Climb on up. Maybe we can cut through here.
What? I don't hear anything.
Oh, shit....
I know.
Drop it!
Okay. How do we get out of this place?
Tess.
Alright, watch your head. Hurry. Go, go, go. Shit...sonofa...
I'm alive. I'll make my way around to you.
Tess?
Shit.
Tess.
Tess!
Shit.
That was too damn close.
Tess, how're you holdin' up?
How 'bout you, kid? You okay?
Are you still breathing?
Yeah, they count.
Alright. Now watch your step as you goin' up 'cause it's gonna be a little...
Well, is that everything you hoped for?
Yes, ma'am.
Let's keep moving, kid.
There we go. Home stretch, Tess.
What are you doing, Tess?
How far are we gonna take this?
What are we doing here? This is not us.
I know that you are smarter than this.
No, we are survivors!
It is over, Tess! Now we tried. Let's just go home.
What?
What are you going on about--
Let me see it.
Show it to me.
Oh, Christ.
No, no, no, that was your crusade. I am not doin' that.
Dammit.
There is no way that--
I can fight--
Ellie.
Get a move on.
Stop.
Stop. You stay close to me. We need to move.
Just keep pushing forward.
We're through.
I got this.
Alright. We're gonna have to go through that hall.
Stay down. I don't know how many more there are.
I see it.
Stay low.
Shit.
Goddammit.
How the hell are you breathin' in this stuff?
We'll figure something out.
There's a ladder. Maybe we can use that.
Get on.
Ellie.
I gotcha.
I got it. Alright, let's get outta here.
Here's how this thing's gonna play out. You don't bring up Tess -- ever. Matter of fact, we can just keep our histories to ourselves. Secondly, don't tell anybody about your condition. They'll think you're crazy or they'll try to kill you. And lastly, you do what I say, when I say it. We clear?
Repeat it.
Good. Now, there's a town a few miles north of here. There's a fella there that owes me some favors. Good chance he can get us a car.
Let's get a move on.
Now there we go... Yeah, it'll be faster to go through here.
What?
You mean the woods?
If she was up to the task, why'd she drop you off on us?
Kid, I don't mean to upset you, but your friend's chances of survival weren't too high to begin with.
It don't matter. 'Cause I doubt I could get either one of us back into the city in one piece. Trust me. I wish there was some other option.
Well, shit.
No, wire on top of it. We gotta find a way to go around.
Yeah, I see that.
Here we go.
That you, Bill?
Huh? Different places.
I know this is where he lives, but...no, I ain't never been here
Sure as hell better be.
Alright, come on. Down here. Watch your step; it's a good drop.
Are you alright?
You don't know how to whistle?
Oh, shit. It's jammed from the other side.
No, that's not such a good idea.
Alright. Gimme your foot. Now just open it. Nothing else.
Careful.
Good job.
Well, then we go find Tommy.
And more importantly he was a Firefly. He'd know where to take you.
He lives far from here which is why we need the car.
Yeah. Those are gnomes.
Alright, then.
What, you play this before?
Well, I was never a big fan of these things.
Where you think? Quarantine zone. See, some places got a head's up before the infection showed up. Most didn't.
That ain't the hard part.
Hmm. Yeah, that's Bill's handiwork.
Far as I know, it's just him.
Yeah, they were. Hoping to restore the country to what it was.
Maybe.
Jesus!
That...would be one of Bill's traps.
Now that's putting it lightly.
Well, he helped us smuggle stuff into the city. He's... He knows how to find things.
Just watch your step. You'll be fine.
I reckon he is.
Hey... Look at that.
How 'bout we just leave this kind of stuff to me.
I don't think so.
Here, we can actually use this. It's all clear, come on up.
Let's give this baby a whirl.
Now, listen. Bill ain't exactly the most stable of individuals. So when we get there, you let me do the talkin'. You understand?
We gotta be clear on this. He... He don't take too kindly to strangers.
Bill's a good guy, he just definitely needs some time warming up to you, that's all.
See that wire? Stay underneath it okay? Just keep your head low and you'll be fine.
Yeah.
I wanna see what we can find.
Don't worry. I got this.
Well, while we're here, let's search the place.
C'mon, let's get the hell outta here.
Shit. Look at this. Alright, stand back.
That's one way to do it.
Yeah, see that? Get back.
Come on. Just stay close. Ellie, come on, just...
Oh, shit!
God...
Goddammit, Bill...
It's another one of Bill's stupid traps! There, that fridge. It looks like that's the counterweight.
Cut that rope and it'll bring me down!
Shit, here they come!
Just tend to the rope! Ellie, how's it looking?
Ellie!
Oh, fuck! Anytime, Ellie.
You alright?
C'mon. You can do it.
Thanks.
Hurry, you're gettin' close.
Dammit...
Alright--
Which way?
Bill, come on!
Oh, shit.
Move, Ellie, move!
Bill.
Bill!
Just calm down a second.
Alright!
Just...ah, take it easy.
No.
No, goddammit, I'm clean!
Stop!
You done?
I'll cut to the chase. I need a car.
By the looks of it, you could stand to lose some of that food.
I need you to shut up. Alright?
Actually, Bill, they are.
But there is one in this town.
Meaning that you could fix one up.
Alright.
That's fine.
Couple days from now, we'll probably be dead anyway.
Knock it off.
Alright, thank you. Ellie, take a look around and see if there's anything we can use.
Just...stay out of his way.
Yeah. Pretty badly, yeah.
Just let it go.
We're good. Alright, Ellie. Come on.
I got it.
Just stay with me.
Yeah, he's one of a kind. I'm gonna take a look around up here.
Thanks.
It's a job. A simple drop-off.
So, where we goin', Bill?
Bill, just...
Shhh. There's one inside
Yeah, somethin' like that. 
Goddammit.
Yeah...Bill?
You picked a hell of a place to hole up, didn't ya?
Nothin'. You sure that gate's gonna hold 'em?
So, which way?
Uh-uh.
No you don't.
No. Just...stay here.
It's up there.
It's actually her idea.
Bill, I can't just take her back.
Bill, it...it ain't like that. It's--
Bill. Can we please just get on with it?
Whatcha got?
Yeah, I've seen your handiwork.
So we got shotguns and bombs. What the hell are we doing with 'em?
So we take that battery and put it in another car.
What if it's damaged?
Actually might work.
Like a hawk.
Nice place you got here.
Alright, I'm not touchin' anything. Just...
Ellie, c'mon.
Alright.
Guess we'll find out.
C'mon, you don't need to be lookin' at that.
Alright then.
I'm on it.
Keep quiet.
Ah, shit... Locked.
Easy, easy.
You weren't kiddin' about this place, were ya?
This way.
It's tied on the other side.
Be very careful.
Okay, Bill.
They ain't seen us yet. Just stay down.
C'mon, Ellie. Alright, I think we're good.
We're all fine. Let's just keep going.
Yeah?
Ellie, you don't need to worry about me. We should go check on Bill.
Yeah?
Well, let's not test our luck. How do we get inside?
Go, go, go, you two! Go!
Shit.
Bill, make it fast! Grab this.
Please tell me you're done!
What?
Bill, where to?
Bill, where?!
Get ready to haul ass. C'mon.
You two, follow me. I'll get us outta here.
Help me open this.
C'mon.
That doesn't sound good.
Ellie, take cover! I got this.
He's been infected for a long time. We call them bloaters.
Let's go, people.
Here we go.
Son of a bitch!
Pull me up. There.
Keep going, I'm right behind you!
Bill?
Then what the hell is plan B?
Don't you bring Tess into this!
She's got nothin' to do with--!
Jesus. What? Do you know this guy or something?
Who the hell's Frank?
I reckon he didn't want to turn so he...
Meaning?
Is that your guess?
Thinkin' you drive and we push.
That's a good idea.
I'll give you a holler.
You gonna be okay with this?
You're doin' a good job. I figure you should know that.
Alright...
Bill, I uh...I found this in there and I...I figured you should have it.
Alright, Bill, let's do it.
Alright, Ellie, get ready... Now! Now, hit it. Hit it!
Bill, not helpin'. Ellie -- we're gonna give it another go. Stay focused!
Alright, Ellie, get ready... Alright, Ellie, start it up!
You hear that sound, Bill?
Just keep it running, alright?
You gotta admit -- she did hold her own back there.
What's this?
Appreciate it. Look, Bill, um, about your buddy back there. Uh... That's
We're square.
Hey, what happened to sleeping?
Where did you get that?
What else did you get?
Y'know, this is actually before my time. That is a winner though.
Oh, man...
Mm-hmm.
Now, Ellie, that ain't for kids.
Get rid of that. Just--
Um...
Why don't you try and get some sleep, alright?
Oh, no, no, no, no. Well, perfect.
Screw it.
Put your seat belt on, Ellie.
Oh, he ain't even hurt.
Hold on!
Then get out quick.
Shit!
Come on.
Catch your breath. We're leaving.
Shit! Stay down!
Alright...I think that's the last of 'em. You OK?
Good, 'cause we need to get the hell out of here. You know the drill.
Well, we sure as hell ain't going back this way. Aggh...c'mon...Alright,
Ellie!
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
Fucking hunters. See, this could've been us.
I knew I should've turned the damn truck around.
Barely. C'mon, let's get outta here.
Know what?
I've been on both sides.
Take it however you want.
It don't matter. Let's just keep moving.
Hey, Ellie, slow down. Wait for me.
How 'bout you let me go first? And keep your voice down.
Oh, good. Something else you can annoy me with.
Cute. And no, my money's on the military.
Can't let everyone in.
And dead people don't get infected. You sacrifice the few to save the
Yeah.
I don't know. Ellie, get down.
What is that?
Let's keep going.
Uh-huh.
That's awful.
Do you even understand what that means?
We'll get there.
This is what most zones look like. This place has been abandoned for a while now.
Sometimes they ran out. Most times they just held onto it.
Trust me, it happened all the time.
Yeah, me too. Let's keep it down while we're going through this area. Okay?
That was too damn close.
Excuse me?
Endure and survive?
Okay.
So you're a reader, huh?
I get it.
Do you even get that?
Alright, I've actually never heard that one.
You get people desperate enough, they'll do just about anything.
That'd be my bet. Let's see where this leads us. Watch yourself on these drops!
Down, down, down, down. There's more of 'em.
Alright. I don't think they saw us.
Let's keep at it. C'mon.
We did. Some just chose to not eat it.
For looks.
3.14...
I get it.
What?
Terrible.
Alright.
That'll do. Put that thing away.
I can't make that jump.
Wait here! Let's see where this goes.
What the hell? Oh, this place is bad.
Get on. We're cuttin' through the hotel.
Set that plank like they did.
Yeah, wood's all rotten.
I did. All the time.
Just...just coffee.
We're about to find out.
It's clear, Ellie. Come on down.
No...no, this is too rich for my blood.
No, it's too high. Let's see what we can find.
Ahhh, I really miss coffee.
The hell are you doin'?
You are a weird kid.
Come on up. Watch your step.
Left?
I don't know, what?
Oh shit. Get down, get down.
It ain't easy -- for many it was better than letting a clicker or hunter
Let's see where this goes.
It's gonna be a tight fit, but come on.
You find something to climb on. Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
I'm alright! Are you okay?
No! Stay up there. I'll make my way up to you!
I'll try.
Maybe that way. That could be it.
Goddamnit. I don't think I tried over there yet.
Over there. I need to find a way around this gate. Well, maybe that
Oh shit.
I hate these things.
Goddammit!
Made it. Ah, so much for that. I gotta find Ellie.
Yeah, you sure did.
Why didn't you just hang back like I told you to?
I'm glad I didn't get my head blown off by a goddamn kid.
We gotta get going.
We need to get back out. Find that bridge.
I hate this crap.
That's a backdrop. People would take their pictures in front of it.
Okay, then. Something on your mind, Ellie?
It don't matter what you thought. I need you to listen to me.
That door looks like a way out. Hey, you see a way to get up there?
Might be able to get through with this. Alright... Goddamn, this is heavier than I thought. Hey, how 'bout a hand?
Ellie... Push.
Push harder!
Let's go.
Oh, shit.
C'mere, keep your head down. Alright now...I'm gonna jump down there and
You stay here.
I am.
Now you seem to know your way around a gun. You reckon you can handle that?
Rats?
Well, it's the same basic concept. Lift it up. Alright now, you're gonna wanna lean right into that stock, 'cause it's gonna kick a hell of a lot more than any BB rifle.
Go ahead and pull the bolt back. Grab it right there. Just tug it. There you go. Now as soon as you fire, you're gonna want to get another round in there quick. Listen to me -- if I get in trouble down there, you make every shot count, yeah?
Alright. And just so we're clear about back there...it was either him or me.
Alright, come on down.
How 'bout something a...little more your size.
It's for emergencies only.
Now, the safety's on. Do you know how to switch it off?
Okay, you just...you gotta respect it. This is not--
Okay.
Shit. It ain't that much different from what the military does back in Boston.
Alright, do your thing, Ellie.
I am.
That's good thinkin'.
Help me open this.
I got it.
Oh shit, get down, get down.
Nothing.
There ain't nothin' we coulda done.
Let's just get to that bridge.
Yeah, I see him. Stay low.
What? Oh, right...the comic book thing.
Well, every battle's got a losing side.
Everyone has a family. Best not to dwell on it.
There ya go.
We're almost there.
"Military Preparatory School".
This place has been out for a good stretch. They ain't kids no more.
Or they got away.
I believe in getting out of this city. Come on.
I saw this right before the outbreak.
Nobody gets gutted. It's a dumb teen movie.
I don't know. Let's just stay focused, alright?
Let's get through the alley.
It's alright, keep your head down.
I think we lost 'em.
We're okay. They can't see us.
Oh, shit.
Sonofa--
Easy, on. Just take it easy.
Yeah, well, I was trying to kill you.
How many are with you?
Ellie.
Alright, take us there.
I promised someone I'd look after her.
They're gone.
How far is this place?
Shit. Ellie, you watch our back.
Are you sure it's safe being so close to them?
And where'd you get that?
No.
So why haven't you left?
And?
That could work.
So where were you headin'?
Yeah...
Just seems like there's a lot of people putting their stock on the
So you don't know where they are and you're just gonna drag him across the country to find 'em?
Easy. We're looking for the Fireflies too.
I guess we best rest up then.
Yeah.
You tried this before?
That's comforting.
I just hope you know the way.
Alright.
I see 'em.
Henry, give me a hand with this.
Oh, no. Hurry, c'mon.
Keep your eyes open, we ain't outta this mess yet.
Alright, check it out.
Alright, kid, c'mon. There you go.
Hurry, hurry!
Ellie!
Oh shit.
C'mon, into the building! Let's go!
Go...
Alright, let's get underneath it.
Oh, shit.
How many bullets do you have left?
What other choice do we have?
No, it's too high and you can't swim. I'll boost you up, you run past 'em.
Oh my god.
Ellie.
Ellie! Ah, damn it!
I got you! No, no, no, no...
Get back, son!
You sure about that?
He left us to die out there.
Yeah. Let's go find that radio tower.
Yeah...almost did.
I think you're right.
Way ahead of you, kid.
What?
Well, it's a little bit different in the water.
Alright, same time. Come on.
Alright, c'mon, kids, go.
You go in.
Uh-huh. Gotta find a different way.
It's blocked.
Well, I don't know. We're just gonna have to see how everything pans out.
Guess we gotta figure somethin' out.
Henry, give it a shot!
I'll go have a look. You keep an eye out.
Yeah! Still in one piece.
Alright, see if that generator's still got some juice.
Oh shit.
It's a sort of alarm.
Someone used to live here. Don't look like that's the case anymore.
Ugh.
Ellie, don't--
Shh, shhh. Quiet.
Seeing as how there was a clicker, they must've been gone for awhile.
Oh shit. Get back!
That was me. I must've triggered some sort of safety gate or somethin'. Henry, see if we can lift this.
What?
Just go, get outta here.
Go! Shh, shh, shh.
We're gonna be fine.
Alright, come on, kid. See if we can find a way outta here, yeah?
We're gonna keep going. You good?
Looks like it.
Son, I wish I knew. God knows they didn't deserve it. You think you can knock that ladder down?
Go ahead.
Good job, kid.
C'mon.
Ellie! Get away from the door!
Alright, go.
Make it fast!
Get ready!
Alright, move! Let's go, let's go!
Oh...
So, where's this tower?
Let's find a way around to it. What about you, how you holdin' up?
Yeah.
Everyone barricaded themselves in their homes, then supplies started running low. That's when you saw what people are really capable of.
You're gonna want to stay away from those. It's not like it is in the zone. These are wild.
It's true. This thing would drive around and play real loud, creepy music and kids would come running out to buy ice cream.
Um-mmm. Serious.
Let's go.
Yeah, by the looks of it.
I know a guy. My brother, actually. He was a Firefly. Last I heard he was in Wyoming. We get there, we find him. We find the Fireflies. Whaddya say, you in?
Oh shit! Get down.
Somewhere down the street. Alright now...y'all stay here.
Before you start -- I need you guys to keep him busy. I'm gonna go around and see if I can't get the angle on him.
Come on, guys... Oh, no, no, no.
Come on, Henry.
Shit.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh god...
Still here. Anybody hurt?
Alright, I think it's time we quit this place. C'mon.
Dead serious. It was Tommy's birthday. That's all he wanted to do is just -- rent two Harleys and drive cross country.
It was good. It was real good.
Yeah.
Good morning.
What the hell?
Shit! He's turnin'!
Screw it!
Ellie? Ellie, are you alright?
Henry. Ellie, stay here. Henry.
I'm gonna get that gun from you, okay?
Whoa. Okay, okay, easy.
This is nobody's fault, Henry.
Henry! Henry, no...
Shouldn't be more than a few miles.
I'm just ready to get there.
I don't know what I'm feeling.
We just follow the river. It'll lead us straight to Tommy's. C'mon.
What do you mean?
We just had a bit of a disagreement, that's all.
Tommy saw the world one way, I saw it the other.
Yeah, your friend Marlene promised him hope. That kept him busy for awhile, but just like Tommy, he eventually quit that too.
I believe his last words to me were "I don't ever want to see your god damned face again."
I suppose we're gonna find out.
Let's just keep going.
That there is a hydroelectric power plant.
It, uh...uses the river's movement and turns it into electricity.
Look. I know what it is, I don't know how it does it.
Alright, Ellie, I need you to--
Go on, give it a spin.
I will.
That's too small of a grave.
Ellie...
No.
How many times do we need to go over this? Things happen...and we move
That's enough.
Let's get to Tommy's.
I know, I am too.
Let's get past this place, then we can scrounge up some food.
Ah, ain't no way around... Gonna have to cut through the plant.
Ellie, do as the lady says.
We didn't know the place was occupied. We're just trying to make our way through.
Tommy.
How you doin', baby brother?
Yeah.
Easy -- it's gonna happen to you too.
Ma'am. Thanks for not blowing my head off.
What the hell are you doin' here? I thought I'd find you in Jackson.
When have you ridden a horse?
I'll come with you. Go with Maria and put some food in you.
I'm good.
I said I'm good.
Tommy, I...I need to talk to you. Privately.
Yeah, Joel. I'm Tommy's--
Apparently.
I see.
It's a pleasure meeting you.
What do you do for protection?
You still gotta deal with those infected though, right?
Well, maybe you don't have to be.
It's pretty impressive. Looks like you're out two million bucks.
That's quite the crew you got here.
I've been on quite the adventure, little brother.
Oh, it's got everything to do with that little girl.
She's immune.
See, I know...I've seen her breathe enough spores to take down a dozen men and nothing. I wouldn't have believed it neither, but I can show you. 
I was supposed to deliver her to the Fireflies... The way I figured it,
But you know where they are. Now I'm not asking for much, Tommy. I just want some simple gear -- enough to set me on my way.
This isn't for me, Tommy. This is for your damn cause.
Jesus, boy...have Maria get some of your born again friends to do it.
Tommy, I need this.
This is how you gonna repay me...huh?
For all those goddamn years I took care of us.
You survived because of me.
I bring you the cure for mankind and you wanna play the pissy little
The hell is that?
Yeah...
That was too damn close.
Okay.
Listen.
Slow down, slow down. Listen--
Hey, hey, are you hurt?
We'll talk about it later.
We'll talk about it later.
Here we go.
Yeah, I know.
It's best this way.
I need to talk to Ellie.
What, what is it?
Damn it. Which way?
Easy, easy.
Yeah.
Stubborn kid.
Nothing like this. I don't know what's going on.
Ellie, what're you thinking? There. More tracks.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Too goddamn many.
C'mon. Back to the horses.
Tracks keep going this way. Just hope they didn't get to her.
Area looks clear.
Ellie? Ellie?!
Jesus Christ.
Get up, we're leaving. C'mon.
Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that.
What do you want from me?
Tommy knows this area better than--
Well, I'm sorry, I trust him better than I trust myself.
How many close calls have we had?
And now you'll be doing even better with Tommy.
What?
Ellie. You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.
You have no idea what loss is.
You're right... You're not my daughter, and I sure as hell ain't your dad. And we are going our separate ways.
I got two walking in.
Hang back.
Alright...house is clear.
We're clear.
Where is this lab of theirs?
Go Big Horns. Ellie, get off your horse, give it on back to Tommy. I'm gonna hang onto this fella, if that's alright with you. Go on. Don't make me repeat myself.
Your wife kinda scares me. I don't want her coming after me.
Eh, you know me. My mind's all made up.
University Eastern Colorado. How do I find this lab?
You take care of that wife of yours.
You good?
Adios, little brother. C'mon.
Right, it's called turnover.
First down, that's right.
You just gotta play it a couple of times. It'll all make sense.
Well, we'll head to central grounds. Should be able to see most of the campus from there.
Stay, Callus. What kind of name is Callus anyway?
Callus.
Yeah, study, party, and find themselves. Figure out what they wanted to do with their lives.
There was a lookout here.
When it came to sports? Hell yeah.
It's that time of year.
Hmm. It does look like a giant mirror.
Reckon it takes quite a crew to run that operation.
Ahh...I'm not sure.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...what is it, boy?
Stay with the horse. I'll go check it out.
Yes. I don't want him runnin' off. I'll be right back.
Huh, looks like someone jerry-rigged this thing. No juice. I'll see if I can get the power back on.
And that's that.
That a fact?
Oh...well, when I was a kid I used to want to be a...a singer.
I'm serious.
Ah, no.
I don't think so.
Yeah, a whole mess of 'em.
First time seeing a monkey?
Uh...maybe these guys like to keep a low profile.
I see it.
Alright, let's try that gate.
You too. Oh, damn it. Spores.
Shit...
More infected. I'm fine!
Alright. Let's try the gate.
Yeah. Come on through. Scootch.
No...no, I don't think so.
Bill used them as a form of defense. Maybe they're doing the same.
Yeah...I'd expect to see someone by now. Let's get inside.
What? A university?
No, not as a student at least.
Uhh...I had Sarah when I was pretty young.
For a while.
Okay.
Too much.
We better.
Yeah. That looks like a way in.
It's rusted shut. We'll have to find another way.
Whoa. Alright, not what I had in mind, but it'll do.
Alright, we're inside. C'mon, kiddo, gimme your hand. There you go.
Do what?
No, no. They'll probably just draw some blood –- it don't hurt.
Let's keep it down until we figure out what's going on.
Ain't nothin' here but a bunch of medical mumbo-jumbo.
Looks like they all just packed up and left in a hurry.
Stay close.
If we find out where they went.
Shit!
Jesus. Well, at least it ain't clickers.
Just keep searching, we'll find something.
Come on.
I know the city.
It ain't close. I mean on horseback--
Get down!
It don't matter. We know where to go, let's get the hell outta here.
Move...
Move!
I'm gonna need you to pull.
Pull!
Just get to the damn horse.
I'm fine...I'm fine.
Yeah.
Ellie.
Shit.
I'm okay.
I'm coming.
No.
Yes.
Behind you!
Ellie!
You wish.
Take your time.
Just...get the horse.
Go.
Ellie? Ellie?! Where the hell are you?
Ellie! Where'd she run off to?
Shit.
You come with me. Come on...
You wait here. Now...the girl...is she alive?
Focus right here. Right here. Or I'll pop your goddamn knee off. The girl.
Where?
Now you're gonna mark it on the map. And it better be the same exact spot your buddy points to. Mark it.
That's alright. I believe him.
What is this? Why is Ellie's stuff here?
Oh, Christ. I gotta find her. I gotta find her.
Holy shit. Ellie...
Ellie! Stop. Stop.
Shhh. Shhh.
It's okay. It's me, it's me. Look, look. It's me.
Oh, baby girl... It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay now.
Ellie! Did you hear me?
Look. Hospital. This is where we get off. Let's go, kiddo. Heh. Feel that breeze, huh? I tell you, on a day like this, I'd just sit on my porch, pick away at my six string. Yeah, once we're done with this whole thing, I'm gonna teach you how to play guitar. Yeah, I reckon you'd really like that. Whaddya say, huh? Ellie, I'm talkin' to you.
Oh yeah?
Go on, tell me about it.
Hmpf. Well, you know, dreams are weird.
Look at that. Another city, another abandoned quarantine zone. There's that hospital the Firefly mentioned. C'mon, kiddo.
Maybe we cut through here, huh? Everything all right?
You just kinda seem extra quiet today.
No, it's not...it's fine.
Well, we could use that ladder. Here we go.
Ellie. Ellie.
The ladder, c'mon.
What is it? Ellie? Ellie!
What is it? I don't see anything. What the hell is--?
What in the Sam Hill?
I won't...I won't...
It's alright. C'mere, c'mere. Hurry up, c'mon. Go on.
Slow down, kiddo.
So...this everything you were hoping for?
We don't have to do this. You know that, right?
Go back to Tommy's. Just...be done with this whole damn thing.
Well, I ain't leavin' without ya, so let's go wrap this up.
Well, this place takes me back.
It was right after everything went down. I ended up in a triage just like this. Man, everywhere you looked, you just...saw families torn apart. The whole damn world seemed to have turned upside-down in a blink.
Yes, it was...
That's okay, Ellie.
Well, no matter how hard you try, I guess you can't escape your past. Thank you.
What do you mean?
Oh, shit.
Stay quiet.
I know. Let's just keep it at.
Stay back.
We killed 'em...I think we got all of 'em.
Endure and survive. Alright, you think you can shove that crate down?
Watch your step. That water looks pretty deep.
What's that?
You got it.
I'm on the other side!
Alright, hold on.
Alright, just stick to the edge. It's shallow over here.
And another jammed door. Alright. Gimme your foot.
C'mon. Get that door open.
You okay?
Just stay put.
Alright, get on.
I gotcha.
Oh shit.
Damn ladder broke off the wall.
I'll figure somethin' out.
Let me go ahead and you follow my lead.
Okay. Come on -- jump.
I got you. See? You didn't even need me.
Ellie -- Ellie, move! Oh shit, I got it!
Son of a bitch! Aw, shit!
Ellie, gimme your hand! Gimme your hand before...
C'mon.
C'mon...c'mon... C'mon...c'mon...
C'mon. She's not breathing.
Come on, Ellie!
And Ellie?
It was her. She fought like hell to get here. Maybe it was meant to be.]
Take me to her.
I worry. Just let me see her, please.
The hell you mean, surgery?
But it grows all over the brain.
Find someone else.
Listen, you are gonna show me where--
Then why are you letting this happen?
Yeah...you keep telling yourself that bullshit.
Which way?
Where is the operating room? I ain't got time for this.
Where?
Where?
Oh shit.
Oh shit. There.
Yeah, that's it. I'm comin', Ellie.
There. C'mon... That should buy me some time.
Sweet Jesus.
Come on, baby girl. I gotcha... Oh shit. Get back!
Shit.
I'm getting you outta here, girl. I got you. I got you.
Come on. Goddamnit, which way?
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay...
I said get back!
C'mon, c'mon.
Oh god.
Okay. Come on, come on.
That ain't for you to decide.
Just take it easy...drugs are still wearing off.
We found the Fireflies. Turns out there's a whole lot more like you, Ellie. People that are immune. It's dozens actually. Ain't done a damn bit of good either. They've actually st-- They've stopped looking for a cure. I'm taking us home. I'm sorry.
You'd just come after her.
Well, looks like we're walking. Should be a straight shot through here.
Actually kinda pretty, ain't it?
Alright. Now watch your head going through.
Oh... Feelin' my age now. Hmpf. Don't think I ever told you, but Sarah and I used to take hikes like this. I think, ah...I think the two of you would've been good friends. Think you really would've liked her. I know she woulda liked you.
Wow. Look down there. Just a little bit further now. Shit. Here, I got you. Gimme your hand.
Alright, come on.
Ellie--
None of that is on you.
I struggled for a long time with survivin'. And you-- No matter what, you keep finding something to fight for. Now, I know that's not what you want to hear right now, but it's--
I swear.
